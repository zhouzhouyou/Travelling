    <h1 class="title">History</h1>
    <p class="text">Situated in the western outskirts of haidian district, the summer palace is 15
        kilometers (9.3
        miles) from central beijing. having the largest royal park and being well preserved, it was
        designated, in 1960
        by the state council, as a key cultural relics protection site of china. containing examples
        of the ancient
        arts, it also has graceful landscapes and magnificent constructions. the summer palace is
        the archetypal chinese
        garden, and is ranked amongst the most noted and classical gardens of the world. in 1998, it
        was listed as one
        of the world heritage sites by unesco.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Experience</h1>
    <p class="text">Constructed in the jin dynasty (1115-1234), during the succeeding reign of
        feudal emperors; it was
        extended continuously. by the time of the qing dynasty (1644-1911), it had become a
        luxurious royal garden
        providing royal families with rest and entertainment. originally called "qingyi garden"
        (garden of clear
        ripples), it was know as one of the famous "three hills and five gardens" (longevity hill,
        jade spring mountain,
        and fragrant hill; garden of clear ripples, garden of everlasting spring, garden of
        perfection and brightness,
        garden of tranquility and brightness, and garden of tranquility and pleasure). like most of
        the gardens of
        beijing, it could not elude the rampages of the anglo-french allied force and was destroyed
        by fire. in 1888,
        empress dowager cixi embezzled navy funds to reconstruct it for her own benefit, changing
        its name to summer
        palace (yiheyuan). she spent most of her later years there, dealing with state affairs and
        entertaining. in
        1900, it suffered again, being ransacked by the eight-power allied force. after the success
        of the 1911
        revolution, it was opened to the public.</p>
