    <h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="text">The Great Wall has a history of over twenty centuries. The first part of it was
        built during the
        Spring and Autumn Period. During the Warring States Period, more walls were put up to defend
        the borders of the
        different kingdoms. It was during the Qin Dynasty that the kingdom of Qin united the
        different parts into one
        empire. To keep the enemy out of his empire, Emperor Qin Shi Huang had all the walls joined
        up. Thus, the Great
        Wall came into being.</p>

    <h1 class="title">History</h1>
    <p class="text">It was very difficult to build such a wall in the ancient days without any
        modern machines. All the
        work was done by hand. Thousands of men died and were buried under the wall they built. The
        Great Wall was made
        not only of stone and earth, but of the flesh and blood of millions of men.</p>
    <h1 class="title">Experience</h1>
    <p class="text">Today the Great Wall has become a place of interest not only to the Chinese but
        to people from all
        over the world. Many of them have come to know the famous Chinese saying: "He who does not
        reach the Great Wall
        is not a true man."</p>
