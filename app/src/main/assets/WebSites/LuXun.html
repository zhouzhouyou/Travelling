    <h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="text">Lu Xun or Lu Hsün (September 25, 1881 – October 19, 1936), the pen name of Zhou Shuren, has
        been considered one of the most influential Chinese writers of the 20th century and the founder of modern
        Chinese, or vernacular, literature. Highly influential in 20th century Chinese history, his literary works
        exerted a substantial influence after the May Fourth Movement. He was also a noted translator.</p>

    <h1 class="title">History</h1>
    <p class="text">Lu Xun, in a widely known account, later explained why he consciously gave up the pursuit of a
        medical career. One day after class, one of his Japanese instructors screened a lantern slide which documented
        an imminent public execution of an alleged Chinese spy by Japanese soldiers. Lu Xun was shocked by the apathy of
        the Chinese at the execution and decided that it was more important to cure his compatriots of their spiritual
        ills rather than their physical diseases. Quitting his studies and returning to China in 1909, he became a
        lecturer in the Peking University and began writing.</p>
    <h1 class="title">Experience</h1>
    <p class="text">Born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang province, Lu Xun was first named Zhou Zhangshu and later renamed Shuren,
        literally, "to nurture a person". His family was well-educated and of the gentry class, yet somehow the family
        ended up being poor by the time he was born. His father's chronic illness and death in his adolescence persuaded
        Zhou to take up medical science. Distrusting traditional Chinese medicine (which in his time was often practiced
        by charlatans), he set out to study Westernized medicine in Tohoku High Medical Institute (nowadays part of
        Tohoku University) in Sendai, Japan.</p>
