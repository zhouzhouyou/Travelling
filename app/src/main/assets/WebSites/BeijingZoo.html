        Like many of Beijing's parks, areas of the zoo have the distinctive look of classical Chinese
        gardens. The grounds combine cultivated flower gardens with stretches of natural scenery, including dense groves
        of trees, stretches of grassland, a small stream, lotus pools and small hills dotted with pavilions and halls.
        The Beijing Zoo mainly exhibits wild and rare animals of China. The Giant Pandas are one of the most popular
        exhibits, but other popular exhibits include the Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkey, Manchurian tigers,
        white-lipped deer, yaks from Tibet, enormous sea turtles , polar bears from the North Pole, kangaroo from
        Australia, and zebras from Africa.</p>
